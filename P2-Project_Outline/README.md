## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will be a glucose monitor with comprehensive data collection. Users will find this app useful because it wil consolidate all their information and datakeep in one place where they can visualize in different and meaning ways. The idea came from the fact that close family members have been diagnosed with Diabetes and needed a more up-to-date manner in which to store their information, rather than using pen and paper. 
### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and login to the app.
Visual Data: Users will be able to view their stored data visually via a graph in chosen time interval (e.g. hours, days, weeks)
Important Notifications: If certain threshold is reached (i.e. high glucose level), then user will be notified and alerted that extra measures might need to be taken(i.e. talk to physician about proper medication, dosage change)
Summary: Create function whereby a log is recorded and information can be summarized to then be able to export.
Record Keeper: Keep a log of medication being used and its respective information

### Technologies
- Java
- Spring
- Thymeleaf
- JavaFX

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn JavaFX in order to create the graphs that I want to implement into the project to keep track of the glucose levels in different intervals. I will also need to find a solution to the problem that I will have in exporting Javascript information so that it can be opened in a readabe format (e.g. JPEG).
